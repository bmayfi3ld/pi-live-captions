# livecaption — design

Live captions for a room: audio leaves a soundboard over USB, a computer streams it to a
speech-to-text service, and the resulting text appears on a webpage within a second.

The constraint that shaped everything: the signal chain isn't available during development. So the
tool has a **replay mode** that streams an audio file through the *same* pipeline at true
wall-clock rate. If replay works end to end, connecting the USB converter is a change of
subcommand, not a change of code path.

---

## 1. Pipeline

One linear flow. Each stage is a package, connected by channels, independently testable.

```
  ┌──────────────┐  chan audio.Frame  ┌────────────┐  chan stt.Transcript  ┌─────────┐
  │ audio.Source │ ─────────────────► │ stt.Engine │ ────────────────────► │   Hub   │
  └──────────────┘  16 kHz mono s16le └────────────┘   interim + final     └────┬────┘
    file │ device                      deepgram │ mock                          │
         │                                                        ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
         └──(tap)──► monitor                                      ▼             ▼             ▼
                     (speakers)                              SSE clients   transcript     metrics
                                                             viewer page     files       /admin
```

Two invariants hold the whole design together:

**Nothing downstream may block the pipeline.** A slow browser, a stalled sound card, or a failing
disk write must never apply backpressure to audio capture. Every fan-out point drops and counts
instead of blocking.

**Every stage has an offline equivalent.** `replay` substitutes for the soundboard, `--engine mock`
substitutes for Deepgram. The full system runs with no hardware, no network, and no API spend —
which is what makes it practical to develop and test.

---

## 2. Audio sources

Both sources shell out to **ffmpeg** and read raw **16 kHz mono signed 16-bit little-endian** PCM
from its stdout.

Why ffmpeg rather than cgo bindings (PortAudio, malgo): the binary stays pure Go with no C
toolchain; ffmpeg absorbs whatever sample rate and channel count the soundboard presents; and the
same code decodes MP3s for replay. One dependency covers capture, decode, resample, downmix and
playback.

| | `replay` (`internal/audio/file.go`) | `live` (`internal/audio/device.go`) |
|---|---|---|
| command | `ffmpeg -i <file> -ac 1 -ar 16000 -f s16le -` | `ffmpeg -f pulse -i <dev> -ac 1 -ar 16000 -f s16le -` |
| paced by | our scheduler | the sound card |
| failure mode | EOF | device disappears → restart with backoff |

### Pacing

ffmpeg decodes as fast as the pipe drains, so in replay mode *the reader* sets the rate. Each chunk
is held until an **absolute deadline** computed from a fixed start time:

```go
due := start.Add(time.Duration(n+1) * interval)
```

Not a `time.Ticker`. With a ticker, every late wakeup pushes all subsequent frames later and the
error accumulates; over a 32-minute file that drift is large enough to invalidate the simulation.
With absolute deadlines a slow iteration is corrected by the next one. `TestFileSourcePacing`
asserts media time and wall time stay within tolerance.

`--speed` scales the interval for quick dry runs. `--loop` restarts for soak tests.

### Chunk size

`--chunk-ms`, default **100 ms** (3200 bytes). Inside Deepgram's recommended 20–250 ms payload
range: small enough not to add meaningful latency, large enough to avoid one WebSocket frame every
20 ms.

### Live hardening

The capture path can degrade in ways that don't stop the audio, so each has a counter behind it:

- **ffmpeg exits** (USB unplugged) → relaunch with exponential backoff, `ffmpeg_restarts_total`.
  Media offset accumulates across restarts so timestamps stay monotonic.
- **ALSA xruns** → stderr is scanned for overrun/underrun tokens, `xruns_total`.
- **Bad device name** → caught at startup by a probe read, so a typo is an immediate clear error
  rather than an infinite restart loop.

### Monitor playback (`replay --monitor`)

To judge caption delay you need to hear the audio while watching the text land. The tap point is
the design decision: playing the original file with a separate player would drift against our
scheduler and ignore `--speed`. Instead the monitor **tees the exact frames already emitted** into
a second ffmpeg writing to the speakers.

So what you hear is bit-identical to what the recognizer receives, released by the same clock. It's
the 16 kHz mono downmix, which is the point — bad source audio becomes *audible* instead of being
inferred from bad transcripts.

Two honesty constraints:

- **`--monitor` requires `--speed 1.0`.** The sink drains at a fixed 16000 samples/sec; at 2× the
  buffer would overflow continuously. Rejected at parse time with an explanatory error.
- **Playback adds a fixed ~80 ms buffer**, so perceived delay *overstates* true caption latency by
  that much. The figure is printed in the banner rather than hidden, and `/admin` reports measured
  latency for comparison.

The tap is a non-blocking send: a stalled sound card drops monitor frames
(`monitor_frames_dropped_total`) and never touches the caption path. A dead playback process is a
warning, not a session failure.

Replay-only. On `live`, monitoring the board feed through the same machine's speakers invites
acoustic feedback into the mics.

---

## 3. Speech-to-text abstraction

```go
type Engine interface {
	Name() string
	Run(ctx context.Context, frames <-chan audio.Frame, out chan<- Transcript) error
}
```

Engines self-register (`stt.Register`) and `main` blank-imports them, so adding AssemblyAI or a
local whisper.cpp touches no existing file.

`Transcript` carries `IsFinal` (text won't be revised), `SpeechFinal` (natural end of utterance),
media-time `Start`/`Duration` for ordering and display, and `CapturedAt`/`ReceivedAt` — the wall-clock
pair latency is actually measured from (see section 6) — so replay and live measure latency
identically regardless of `--speed`.

`Run` owns its own reconnect logic: it returns only when the context is cancelled or frames run
out, never on a dropped connection.

### Deepgram (`internal/stt/deepgram`)

`wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen`, header `Authorization: Token <key>`:

```
encoding=linear16&sample_rate=16000&channels=1&model=nova-3&language=en-US
&interim_results=true&punctuate=true&smart_format=true
&endpointing=300&utterance_end_ms=1000&vad_events=true
```

**WebSocket library: `github.com/coder/websocket`.** Worth recording why, since gorilla/websocket
is the better-known name: **gorilla is archived and no longer actively developed.** coder/websocket
is the former `nhooyr.io/websocket`, adopted by Coder in 2024 and maintained. It also fits better —
`context.Context` on every read and write maps onto our cancellation-driven shutdown, and it
serializes concurrent writes internally (we have a PCM writer and a KeepAlive ticker sharing one
connection, which gorilla would require a hand-rolled mutex for).

Used directly rather than via `deepgram-go-sdk`: it's a single endpoint, the client is small, and
the official SDK has lagged on new streaming models. Reversible if that changes.

Structure: a writer goroutine (PCM → binary frames, `{"type":"KeepAlive"}` every 5 s when idle) and
a reader goroutine (JSON → `Transcript`). On shutdown it sends `{"type":"CloseStream"}` and drains
remaining results so the tail of a session isn't lost. On disconnect it reconnects with exponential
backoff (250 ms → 8 s, jittered), holding ~2 s of audio in a bounded drop-oldest ring so a brief
blip loses nothing.

### Auto-pause

Deepgram bills by streamed duration, and a quiet room — before doors open, over a long
intermission, after the event ends but before someone remembers to Ctrl-C — streams silence at
exactly the same rate as speech. Auto-pause (`internal/stt/gate.go`) closes the recognizer
connection entirely during a confirmed stretch of silence and reopens it when audio returns, so
dead air costs nothing.

Silence is detected per frame as RMS level in dBFS, compared against `--silence-threshold-db`
(default **-45**). A single quiet frame doesn't pause anything — the `Gate` requires the level to
stay at or below the threshold for `--silence-hold` (default **60 s**) of *continuous media time*
before flipping inactive, and resume is instant on the next frame that crosses back above
threshold. Media time, not wall clock, is what `Observe` keys off (frame offsets, same as
everywhere else in the pipeline) so a hold period behaves identically whether audio is arriving
live or via `replay --speed 20`, and is deterministic in tests.

The pause **closes the WebSocket**, it doesn't just stop writing to it. Deepgram does document
`KeepAlive` as a way to hold a connection open without being charged for the idle time, so simply
withholding audio would probably also avoid the bill — but "probably" is doing a lot of work in
that sentence, and it stakes the cost of a long intermission on a provider's billing behaviour for
a connection we're deliberately not using. A closed socket cannot be billed by anyone, needs no
footnote, and doesn't change meaning if Deepgram's pricing does. Closing means a real reconnect
(fresh handshake, fresh `Authorization`) when speech resumes.
That reconnect is where the engine's existing ~2 s drop-oldest ring buffer (see Deepgram, above)
earns a second job: it keeps filling from live frames while the connection is down, so by the time
the redial completes there's already a couple of seconds of pre-roll queued to send, and the first
word after silence isn't clipped waiting on handshake latency.

`--auto-pause` / `--no-auto-pause` (default **on**) is the escape hatch for a venue where dead air
is meaningful (e.g. captioning is expected to keep running through a scripted silence) or for
debugging with a stable connection. `pauses_total` and `paused_sec` on `stt` in `/api/stats` (and
therefore `/admin` and the status line) count how often and how long, so the savings — or a gate
that's mistuned for a noisy room — are visible rather than inferred from a Deepgram invoice.

### Mock (`internal/stt/mock`)

Emits canned phrases with realistic interim → final progression, driven entirely by media time from
the frames — never wall clock — so output is identical at any `--speed` and reproducible in tests.
This is what the web layer is developed against.

### Mock-2 (`--engine mock-2`)

`mock` never goes quiet — it's continuous canned speech — so it can't exercise auto-pause, and a
real recording good enough to contain a genuine 60 s silence is an awkward thing to keep around
just for that. `mock-2` solves this by driving the *real* `Gate` with a synthetic level schedule
instead of real frame RMS: 20 s loud, then silent for the configured `--silence-hold` plus 20 s
(so the hold is always reached and the paused state stays visible for a while, whichever hold is
configured), repeating, still keyed off media time via `Gate.ObserveLevel`. Point `replay` at any
file with `--engine mock-2` and the connection will pause and resume on a predictable cadence
regardless of what the audio actually contains — enough to see the behavior end to end, and to
write engine-level tests against it, without paying for a single second of real Deepgram usage.

---

## 4. Caption hub

A recognizer emits many interims per utterance, then one or more `is_final` segments, then
`speech_final`. The hub (`internal/caption/hub.go`) turns that into stable display lines:

| input | effect |
|---|---|
| interim | replaces the uncommitted tail only |
| `is_final` | commits a segment; line stays open |
| `speech_final` / `UtteranceEnd` | closes the line, appends to history |

Only `speech_final` closes a line — otherwise captions flicker and split mid-sentence. `Flush()` at
shutdown closes anything still open.

**Fan-out never blocks.** Subscribers get a 16-deep buffered channel; one that can't keep up is
dropped and counted (`slow_disconnects_total`) rather than backpressured. `EventSource` reconnects
on its own and receives a fresh snapshot, so the cost of a drop is one round trip.

History is capped at 200 lines for late-joiner snapshots — a browser refreshed mid-session is never
blank.

---

## 5. Web server

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | Viewer page |
| `GET /events` | SSE stream: `snapshot` on connect, then incremental events |
| `GET /admin` | Metrics dashboard (no auth) |
| `GET /api/stats` | JSON metrics snapshot |
| `GET /api/time` | Server wall clock, for the viewer's own clock-offset estimation |
| `POST /api/viewer-latency` | Viewer-reported publish→paint latency (unauthenticated, rate-limited — see §6) |
| `GET /logo` | Logo image, registered only when `--logo` is set |
| `GET /healthz` | Liveness |

SSE rather than WebSocket: traffic is strictly one-way, and `EventSource` gives automatic
reconnection with no client-side logic to maintain. Headers set `no-cache` and `X-Accel-Buffering:
no`, every event is flushed immediately, and a `: ping` comment every 15 s keeps idle proxies from
closing the connection.

Event wire format:

```json
{"seq":42,"kind":"final","id":"u17","text":"...","offset_ms":91230,"at":"2026-08-19T09:31:05.912Z"}
{"seq":43,"kind":"interim","text":"partial words so far","at":"2026-08-19T09:31:06.001Z"}
{"seq":44,"kind":"status","state":"reconnecting","detail":"stt websocket closed","at":"2026-08-19T09:31:10.442Z"}
{"seq":45,"kind":"status","state":"paused","detail":"","at":"2026-08-19T09:31:40.000Z"}
```

`at` (the publish instant) is stamped on every kind by `newEventLocked`, not just `final` and
`snapshot` — it used to be absent from `interim` and `status` entirely (the field is `omitzero`),
until the viewer-latency work needed it on interims too, since that's what a viewer sees first.

`detail` is deliberately left empty for `paused`: the server reports *that* the state changed, but
the wording shown for it ("no audio" on the viewer, "paused (no audio)" on `/admin`) is a
presentation decision that belongs to each page, not something baked into the wire event.

Pages are `//go:embed`-ed so the binary ships standalone; `--dev-static` serves from disk while
iterating.

**Viewer.** The page typesets itself instead of trusting the browser to wrap: one
`CanvasRenderingContext2D` measures each candidate word against the row width before placing it.
A browser reflow moves words the reader has already passed sideways and downward on every
interim; measuring client-side and never re-wrapping avoids that class of motion entirely.

A row closes on exactly two triggers — the next word doesn't fit, or the utterance ends — and both
run the same freeze-and-glide path: the active row is marked frozen, a new row is appended below
it, and the whole stack glides up by exactly one row height. The governing invariant: a word, once
painted, never changes font, never moves sideways, and never moves down. It only ever moves up.

State (`live` / `settled` / `stale`) is carried by **color only**, never by font — changing glyph
metrics mid-word reflows text the reader is already reading. This replaced the old italic
"pending" line. The trade-off: an interim can still retroactively rewrite earlier words in the
open row, but once a word has scrolled into a frozen row it is never corrected — it is darkened
(`stale`) instead, so a reader can see the recognizer disowned it without any layout moving.

`computeMetrics()` calibrates canvas measurement against a hidden probe row's real rendered width,
because canvas resolves a font stack independently of layout and an under-measure would clip a
word rather than wrap it. `retypeset()`, debounced off `ResizeObserver` and `visualViewport`
resize, is the only path that ever reflows text — everything else only appends. `?lines=` now
means visible rows, not utterances.

The phone is the primary viewer, so it sets the defaults rather than being an afterthought: type
is larger in portrait (`4vw` is unreadable at phone widths), the visible row count is capped by
what actually fits so a short landscape screen loses a row instead of clipping one, and the page
holds a screen wake lock for as long as it's open and visible — a handset sleeping mid-event is
the likeliest way this interface fails. The Wake Lock API is secure-context only, and the standard
deployment is plain HTTP to a LAN address (adding TLS would mean a browser cert warning on every
phone at every event), so `navigator.wakeLock` is simply undefined there. The viewer falls back to
a silent looping `<video>` — the NoSleep.js technique — as the only mechanism that keeps a screen
on over insecure HTTP. That backend needs one user gesture to unlock video playback, met by a
one-time full-screen tap gate on first load (skippable with `?wake=0` for OBS sources and
unattended displays, which have nobody present to tap it). The same URL still serves a projector
and an OBS browser source.

**Admin** — polls `/api/stats` once a second. Simpler than SSE for a single operator client.

---

## 6. Metrics

`internal/metrics` holds one snapshot that the admin page, the status line and the shutdown summary
all read from — so they cannot disagree with each other.

The governing rule: **anything that can degrade silently gets a counter.** A session that quietly
dropped 3 % of its audio must not look identical to a clean one.

| group | fields |
|---|---|
| source | frames/bytes/seconds, `frames_dropped_total`, `ffmpeg_restarts_total`, `xruns_total`, `ffmpeg_last_stderr` |
| monitor | `enabled`, `device`, `buffer_ms`, `alive`, `frames_dropped_total` |
| stt | `state` (now including `paused`), `reconnects_total`, `buffer_drops_total`, `pauses_total`, `paused_sec`, `interim_total`, `final_total`, `bytes_sent_total`, `last_error`, final latency last/p50/p95/max/samples, interim latency last/p50/p95/max/samples, per-phase (upload/recognize/assemble) latency last/p50/p95/max plus `phase_latency_samples` |
| web | `sse_clients`, `sse_clients_total`, `events_total`, `slow_disconnects_total`, viewer-reported latency last/p50/p95/max/samples, `viewer_reports_total` |
| transcript | `path`, `lines_written`, `bytes_written`, `last_write_error` |
| process | `version`, `session_id`, `started_at`, `uptime`, `goroutines`, `health` |

`source.frames_dropped_total` no longer has a caller. It used to double as the counter for the
Deepgram reconnect ring evicting buffered audio, but that's an STT-side event, not a source-side
one, so it moved to `stt.buffer_drops_total` — and an eviction that happens while the gate is
paused is the pre-roll buffer working as designed (see Auto-pause, above) and isn't counted at all
any more. The field stays in `Source` as the slot for a genuine source-side drop, should ffmpeg or
the capture backend ever need one; it just isn't the metric to watch for reconnect-driven loss —
`stt.buffer_drops_total` is.

**Latency** is `ReceivedAt − CapturedAt`: how far behind wall clock the caption for a given piece of
audio arrived. `CapturedAt` is the wall-clock instant the audio was released into the pipeline
(`audio.Frame.CapturedAt`), not a media-time offset from stream start — a per-connection
`anchorIndex` (`internal/stt/deepgram/anchor.go`) maps the media-time `start`/`duration` Deepgram
echoes back to that wall-clock instant, interpolating within the chunk it falls in. A stream-relative
anchor (`streamStart + Start + Duration`) doesn't work here: auto-pause, reconnects, ring evictions
and ffmpeg restarts all move the media clock relative to the wall, so on a long session with quiet
stretches a stream-relative figure grew without bound instead of reporting real latency. Anchoring to
the wall-clock capture instant sidesteps all of that.

The figures are windowed, not session-lifetime. `latencySeries` (`internal/metrics/metrics.go`)
keeps only samples from the trailing `latencyWindow` (5 minutes), capped at `latencyCap` (512
samples) as a memory bound; both percentiles and `max` are computed over that window on read,
and trimming happens on every read too, so an idle session's window actually empties out rather
than showing stale figures forever. There used to be a non-decaying session-lifetime max; it's
gone on purpose. With `--auto-pause` on by default, `writeLoop` flushes up to ~2 s of
genuinely-old ring pre-roll after every resume (§3), so the first final after each silence is a
true but large latency reading — under a non-decaying max that dragged `p95`/`max` up permanently
on a schedule tied to room silence, not to any actual pipeline problem. Windowing lets that spike
age out instead of defining the headline figure for the rest of the session.

Interim and final latency are recorded as separate series (`stt.interim_latency_*_ms` vs
`stt.latency_*_ms`). A viewer sees interim text well before the `SpeechFinal` that closes a line,
so timing finals alone was pessimistic about perceived latency; `observeLatency`
(`internal/cli/run.go`) now measures `ReceivedAt − CapturedAt` for every transcript with non-empty
`Text` and routes the sample to the interim or final series by `IsFinal`. (The empty-`Text` guard
exists because Deepgram's synthetic `UtteranceEnd` transcript carries no real media range —
`anchorIndex.At(0)` on it can resolve an unrelated capture instant — see the spec's 2026-08-22
update for how that surfaced.)

For finals, `observeLatency` additionally splits the total into three phases using
`Transcript.SentAt` — the wall-clock instant the audio was handed to the recognizer's socket,
carried alongside `CapturedAt` through `anchorIndex.Add`/`At` — plus the hub's own publish
instant: upload (`CapturedAt → SentAt`), recognize (`SentAt → ReceivedAt`), assemble
(`ReceivedAt → publish`). `Metrics.ObservePhases` records all three under one lock or none at
all, so the split is exact *per sample*: for any one final, upload + recognize + assemble equals
that final's own `CapturedAt`→publish span. A partial write would let a segment describe a
different transcript than its neighbours, which is why the three are all-or-nothing.

Note the limit of that guarantee: it is per-sample, not per-percentile. The `/admin` waterfall
draws p50 per phase, and percentiles of three separate series do not add — the p50 of upload plus
the p50 of recognize is not the p50 of the total, since the slowest upload and the slowest
recognition need not have happened on the same caption. The bar therefore shows the *composition*
of a typical caption, not an arithmetic decomposition of the headline figure above it, and its
segments are scaled against the sum of the p50s rather than against that headline. Exposed as
`stt.{upload,recognize,assemble}_latency_{last,p50,p95,max}_ms` plus
`stt.phase_latency_samples`. Capture itself (ADC → `CapturedAt`) is not part of this split and
remains unmeasured; the waterfall draws it as an explicitly-labelled, fixed-width hatched segment
rather than pretending to scale it.

The browser leg — publish to actual paint — is measured by the viewer itself and reported
voluntarily: `GET /api/time` lets the page estimate its clock offset against the server (an
uncorrected phone clock is routinely seconds off and would otherwise leak straight into the
figure as fake latency), and `POST /api/viewer-latency` accepts the viewer's own
`requestAnimationFrame`-measured publish→paint span, throttled to 1/sec and withheld until an
offset has actually been measured. It's the first POST route in the codebase, and unauthenticated
on the LAN by design, so it carries its own guards: a bounded request body, a finite-and-in-range
check on the value, and a rate limit shared across all clients rather than per-client. Landed as
`web.viewer_latency_*_ms` and `web.viewer_reports_total`.

See `specs/2026-08-20_analysis_caption_latency_measurement.md` for the full accuracy analysis
this anchor came from, updated 2026-08-22: the anchor-bug findings, the windowed ring/max, the
interim/final split, and the browser-side instrumentation described above are all now fixed.
Only the capture side — ADC/USB/audio-server delay before `CapturedAt`, and recovering ffmpeg's
own PTS — remains open, deliberately deferred as the smallest term in the latency budget; see
"Remaining work" there.

**`Snapshot.Health`** (`"closed"` / `"paused"` / `"degraded"` / `"ok"`) is the server-computed
answer to "what is happening right now," and it's what `/admin`'s badge switches on — a closed or
paused connection reports exactly that rather than a generic "degraded," and once the link is up
again the badge recovers instead of latching at "degraded" for the rest of the session. A point
event (a buffer drop, a reconnect) only holds `Health` at `"degraded"` for `degradedWindow` (60 s)
after it happens, so a single blip from an hour ago doesn't flag the badge forever — that's the fix
for the earlier permanently-latched "Degraded" state. The one asymmetry worth knowing: a standing
transcript write error holds `Health` at `"degraded"` regardless of that window, because unlike a
point event it's a condition, not something that happened once — it stays true for as long as
writes are actually failing, and aging it out on the same timer would let the badge go green while
the transcript diagnostic panel right below it is still showing a live error.

**`Snapshot.Clean()`**, by contrast, answers "was this whole session clean": it reports whether
every degradation counter was zero from start to finish, and never recovers once something has gone
wrong, unlike `Health`. It's the cumulative counterpart to `Health`'s live snapshot — for a caller
that wants a single end-of-session yes/no rather than the moment-to-moment picture.

---

## 7. Transcripts

**On by default for every session.** Recording is the expected behaviour, not something to remember
to enable. `--transcript-dir` (default `./transcripts`, or `LIVECAPTION_TRANSCRIPT_DIR`) relocates
it; `--no-transcript` is the explicit opt-out.

Per session, `<dir>/<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS>/`:

- `transcript.txt` — `[00:12:34] text`, for humans
- `transcript.jsonl` — one record per line with offsets and timestamps, for tooling

Both `O_APPEND`, buffered, flushed every 2 s and on close, so a crash keeps what already landed.
Write failures surface as a metric rather than an error — losing the transcript must not end a live
event.

---

## 8. CLI

`github.com/alecthomas/kong`. Struct tags declare env binding, enum validation, file-existence
checks (`--logo`, like `replay`'s file argument) and grouped help, removing a page of hand-written
validation. Subcommands rather than a `--source` flag, because replay and live take genuinely
disjoint options.

```bash
livecaption devices                              # find the soundboard
livecaption replay recording.mp3 --engine mock   # primary dev loop, no API cost
livecaption replay recording.mp3 --monitor       # hear it while watching captions land
livecaption live --device <soundboard>           # the real thing
```

Shutdown: SIGINT/SIGTERM → cancel → ffmpeg stops → frames channel closes → engine sends
`CloseStream` and drains → hub flushes the open utterance → transcript flushed → HTTP server
`Shutdown` with a 5 s grace. A second Ctrl-C exits immediately.

---

## 9. Terminal output

The governing rule: **captions are data, logs are diagnostics.** Finalized captions go to
**stdout**; everything else to **stderr**. So `livecaption replay f.mp3 > captions.txt 2> run.log`
splits cleanly and piping never mixes the two.

`internal/ui` owns the terminal behind one mutex — the status line and the log handler both target
stderr, and without a single owner they interleave into garbage.

`--log-format=auto` resolves by TTY detection:

| | captions | status line | logs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **terminal** | coloured | pinned, redrawn 2×/sec | pretty, coloured, relative timestamps |
| **piped / systemd** | plain | none | `slog` JSON |

- `error` — the run cannot continue (ffmpeg won't start, key rejected, port in use)
- `warn` — degraded but running (reconnect, xrun, viewer dropped). *The level that matters
  mid-event*, and the one that gets a coloured glyph.
- `info` *(default)* — lifecycle only; a two-hour event should produce well under 50 lines
- `debug` — per-utterance results, backoff decisions, ffmpeg stderr, SSE connect/disconnect

No per-frame logging at any level — at 100 ms chunks that's 10 lines/sec of noise.

## 10. Operating notes

- **Feed a mono aux/matrix send of the mics, not the main mix.** Music beds and effects degrade
  accuracy badly and `-ac 1` will happily downmix all of it. This is the single biggest accuracy
  lever in the project — larger than any model or parameter choice.
- **`--keyterm`** with the event's proper nouns (names, places, in-house terms) is the second
  biggest lever, and costs nothing.
- **Deepgram bills by streamed audio duration**, and replay at 1.0× costs exactly what live costs.
  Use `--engine mock` for all UI work.
- If captions feel late, `endpointing` and `utterance_end_ms` are the knobs: lower closes lines
  sooner at the cost of more mid-sentence breaks. Tune by ear with `--monitor` *before* the event.
- 401 on first connect is the most likely first-run failure — check `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`.
