# livecaption

Streams audio — from a soundboard's USB output or from an audio file — to a speech-to-text
service and serves the resulting captions to a webpage in near real time, for live-event
captioning. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the architecture and the reasoning behind it.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` on `PATH` (used for capture, decode, resample, and playback)
- A [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) API key, set via `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` or `--api-key`

`--engine mock` needs neither a key nor network access — it emits canned transcripts driven by
media time, which is what makes the tool testable without hardware or API spend. `--engine mock-2`
does the same but additionally drives auto-pause (see below) on a fixed schedule, for exercising
that behavior offline.

## Build

```bash
go build -o livecaption ./cmd/livecaption
./livecaption version
```

Or run directly with `go run ./cmd/livecaption <command>`.

## Commands

### `devices` — find the soundboard

```bash
livecaption devices
```

Lists capture inputs per backend (`pulse`, `alsa`) with the name to pass to `--device`.
Enumeration is best-effort (it shells out to `ffmpeg -sources`); an empty list on your machine
just means that backend didn't answer, not that you have no audio hardware.

### `replay` — the no-cost dev loop

Streams an audio file through the real pipeline at wall-clock rate, so everything downstream
behaves exactly as it will with the live feed:

```bash
livecaption replay recording.mp3 --engine mock --no-transcript
```

This is the primary development loop: no API key, no network, no Deepgram spend, and output is
reproducible at any `--speed` since the mock engine is driven by media time, not the wall clock.
`--speed 20` blows through a half-hour file in under two minutes for a quick sanity check;
`--loop` restarts on EOF for soak testing.

Swap in `--engine mock-2` to see auto-pause without waiting for real silence: it drives the same
gate that `deepgram` uses, but off a synthetic level schedule instead of the actual
(continuous-speech) audio — 20 s loud, then silent for `--silence-hold` plus 20 s (so the hold is
always reached and the paused state stays visible for a while, whatever `--silence-hold` is set
to) — so the connection visibly pauses and resumes on a predictable cadence — useful for checking
the viewer/admin/status-line indicators without an idle room to record.

To judge caption delay by ear, add `--monitor`:

```bash
livecaption replay recording.mp3 --monitor
```

This tees the exact frames sent to the recognizer into a second ffmpeg writing to your speakers —
what you hear is bit-identical to what the recognizer receives. `--monitor` requires `--speed 1.0`
(the sink drains at a fixed rate) and adds a printed ~80 ms of playback buffer, so perceived delay
slightly overstates true caption latency. Use it to tune `--keyterm` and to get a feel for lag
*before* an event, not during one.

### `live` — the real thing

```bash
livecaption live --device <name-from-devices> --keyterm "Anthropic" --keyterm "Claude"
```

`--device` is validated against `livecaption devices` output before capture starts (best-effort;
if enumeration fails outright for the chosen backend, validation is skipped with a logged warning
rather than blocking the run), and then confirmed with a probe read before the session begins — so
a typo is a clear startup error, not room noise captioned as your event.

### Auto-pause

Both `live` and `replay` close the Deepgram connection during silence and reopen it when audio
returns, so a quiet room doesn't rack up recognizer charges (see DESIGN.md §3 for how it decides
what counts as silence and why closing rather than idling the connection). It's on by default:

| flag | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--auto-pause` / `--no-auto-pause` | on | enable/disable the feature |
| `--silence-threshold-db` | `-45` | dBFS at or below which a frame counts as silence |
| `--silence-hold` | `60s` | how long silence has to hold (in media time) before pausing |

Turn it off with `--no-auto-pause` for a venue where dead air should still keep the connection
warm, or raise `--silence-hold` if quiet-room pauses are firing during ordinary pauses for breath.
`/admin` and the status line report `pauses_total` and `paused_sec` so a mistuned gate is visible
rather than inferred from the Deepgram bill.

### Speech timing

Two flags, tuned together at a venue since they're the two speech-timing thresholds — even though
they control different things (see DESIGN.md §4):

| flag | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--endpointing` | `100ms` | Silence before Deepgram finalizes a chunk of speech. Lower puts words on screen sooner in smaller pieces. |
| `--speech-break` | `1.5s` | Pause that counts as the speaker actually stopping. Freezes the caption row where it is and closes a transcript line. |

`--speech-break` must stay well above `--endpointing` — the CLI rejects a value that isn't, since
otherwise every chunk Deepgram commits to would also count as a pause and the display goes back to
being ragged. Watch `Segments / lines` on `/admin` while tuning `--endpointing`: roughly 1–3
segments per line is healthy, and a ratio climbing well past that means phrases are fragmenting.

### `version`

```bash
livecaption version
```

## Transcripts

On by default — every session writes to `./transcripts/<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS>/`, both
`transcript.txt` (human-readable, timestamped) and `transcript.jsonl` (one record per line, for
tooling). Change the location with `--transcript-dir` or `LIVECAPTION_TRANSCRIPT_DIR`; disable
with `--no-transcript`.

## Viewer and admin

The viewer page is served at the `--addr` you configured (default `http://localhost:8080/`). It's
a bottom-anchored rolling caption window sized in `vw`, so the same URL works on a phone, a
projector, or as an OBS browser source. `--logo <file>` puts an image in the top-right corner
beside the connection dot. Query parameters:

| param | effect |
|---|---|
| `?lines=N` | number of caption rows shown (overrides `--lines`) |
| `?size=N` | base font size in `vw` |
| `?theme=light` | light theme (default is dark) |
| `?debug=1` | overlays measured latency, plus this viewer's own measured publish→paint time and its estimated clock offset from the server |
| `?logo=0` | hides the logo (e.g. for OBS, where branding is composited downstream) |
| `?wake=0` | disables the screen wake lock entirely, gate included (OBS browser sources, wall-mounted displays — nobody there to tap it) |

Over plain HTTP — the standard LAN deployment — the browser's Wake Lock API is unavailable outside
a secure context, so the viewer falls back to a silent looping video to keep the screen on. That
needs one tap to unlock playback, so the page shows a one-time "Tap to start" gate before captions
become visible; captions are already streaming in behind it, so tapping reveals current state
rather than an empty page. `?wake=0` skips this entirely.

`/admin` is a metrics dashboard (no auth) polling `/api/stats` once a second — restarts, xruns,
STT reconnects, buffer drops, auto-pause count and total paused time, SSE client counts, and
latency: caption-segment percentiles over a trailing 5-minute window headline the page — since
every segment reaching the display is already settled text, that figure *is* time-to-first-pixels,
with no separate interim reading to reconcile it against — alongside a second row for
viewer-reported publish→paint latency, plus a waterfall breaking a segment's latency into upload /
recognize / assemble phases (with the unmeasured capture leg drawn as a labelled hatched segment)
and the separately-sampled viewer leg set off by a gap. A `Segments / lines` stat shows
`segments_total` against `lines_total` — the fragmentation readout for `--endpointing`: roughly
1–3 segments per line is healthy, and a ratio climbing well past that means phrases are splitting
on every hesitation and `--endpointing` should go up. A status badge at the top reads `ok` /
`degraded` / `paused` / `closed`: an auto-pause
shows as "STT Paused," not "Degraded" — it's expected, money-saving behaviour, not a fault — and a
past blip (a reconnect, a buffer drop) only holds the badge at "Degraded" briefly rather than for
the rest of the session. Check it during an event to confirm nothing is degrading silently.

## stdout vs stderr

Finalized captions go to stdout; everything else (logs, status line) goes to stderr, so they split
cleanly:

```bash
livecaption replay recording.mp3 > captions.txt 2> run.log
```

At the default log level, stdout carries no captions — watching a session only shows the status
line on stderr, so the terminal doesn't fill up with caption text. Pass `-v` / `--log-level=debug`
to get the live stream on stdout (e.g. for the redirect above). Either way, every line is also
written to `transcripts/<session>/transcript.txt`.

## Running an event: a short checklist

- **Feed a mono aux/matrix send of the mics, not the main mix.** `-ac 1` will happily downmix
  music and effects along with speech; this is the single biggest accuracy lever in the project.
- **Set `--keyterm` for every proper noun** in the event (names, places, in-house terms) — costs
  nothing, helps a lot.
- **Do a `--monitor` dry run beforehand** (on `replay`, with representative audio) to hear and tune
  perceived delay before you're live.
- **Check `/admin` shows a clean run** — no restarts, no reconnects, no buffer drops — before
  trusting the feed.

## Troubleshooting

- **401 on first connect** — check `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` (or `--api-key`).
- **`unknown stt engine`** — only `deepgram`, `mock`, and `mock-2` are registered; check `--engine`.
- **No devices listed by `devices`** — confirm `ffmpeg` is on `PATH` and a sound server (PulseAudio
  / PipeWire) is running; `alsa` enumeration commonly comes back empty even when ALSA devices work
  fine, so also try known names like `hw:0,0` or `default` directly with `live --backend alsa`.
- **Captions lagging** — `--endpointing` (default `100ms`) controls how long Deepgram waits for
  silence before it commits a chunk of speech; lowering it puts words on screen sooner in smaller
  pieces. Watch `Segments / lines` on `/admin` while you tune it — a ratio climbing well past a
  few segments per line means it's too low and phrases are fragmenting. Tune by ear with
  `--monitor` before the event, and see DESIGN.md §4.
- **First word after a quiet spell is missing/late, or the connection pauses during ordinary
  pauses for breath** — auto-pause; loosen it with a lower `--silence-threshold-db` (more negative)
  or a longer `--silence-hold`, or disable it with `--no-auto-pause`. See "Auto-pause" above.
